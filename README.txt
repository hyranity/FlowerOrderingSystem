This application serves as part of the submission for the BACS 2163 Software Engineering assignment, completed by group members Johann Lee Jia Xuan, Jane Lynette Joannes, Kelvin Ng Tiong Kiat and Ryan Izzat Razali Koroh, of RSD 2 tutorial group 8.

The application is a itself is a web-based application built upon JSP pages and related languages, and it acts as a flower ordering system for Glory Florist, a local florist. It revolves around the functionalities of customer account management, the ordering and delivering of products, as well as managing products and orders as a staff member. We have designed the appropriate pages to fulfill these functionalities, although it should be noted that the end result acts more as a prototype design, rather than a fully-functioning system.

In order to run the application, open the project file in a JSP-supporting IDE (NetBeans is recommended), and simply run the application. For example, in NetBeans, click the green 'Run' arrow button near the top of the window to run the application. Once that has been done, the web application should be opened in a web browser of one's choice. The starting screen will be the Gallery page, and from here one is able to navigate and thus access the rest of the web application's pages.
